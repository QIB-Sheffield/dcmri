        "\n# An exploration of water exchange effects\n\nThis tutorial will explore the effect of water exchange in a standard two-compartmental tissue with extended Tofts kinetics. Data acquisition is modelled using the steady-state model of a spoiled gradient echo sequence.\n\nThe three tissue compartments involved are the blood, interstitium and tissue cells. The effect of water exchange between blood and interstitium (**transendothelial** water exchange) and between intersitium and tissue cells (**transcytolemmal** water exchange) is separately investigated. The water exchange in the blood compartment, particularly between plasma and red blood cells, is assumed to be in the fast exhange limit throughout. \n"

Without transcytolemmal exchange the extravascular curve lines up with the no-exchange model (middle panel). The first pass is closer to the fast-exchange signal but does not align with it completely as it is partly obscured by already extravasated indicator.\n\n4.
