# We are only fitting here the first scan data, so the xdata are the aorta- and liver time points of the first scan, and the ydata are the signals at these time points:
#
xdata = (data['time1aorta'], data['time1liver'])
ydata = (data['signal1aorta'], data['signal1liver'])
#
# Train the model using these data and plot the results to check that the model has fitted the data:
#
model.train(xdata, ydata, xtol=1e-3)
model.plot(xdata, ydata)
