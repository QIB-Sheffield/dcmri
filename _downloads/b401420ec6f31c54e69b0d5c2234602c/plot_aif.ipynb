The AIF avoids this pitfall, and ensures that any systemic differences between subjects are not misinterpreted as differences in tissue properties. \n\nTo illustrate how this works, let's treat the signals generated above as measurements and use them to determine the unknown perfusion and vascularity of the grey matter of subjects A and B. \n\n"

        "## The case for population AIFs\nThe difficulty with the approach outlined above is that this requires an (accurate) measurement of the arterial concentration or signal in individual subjects. This is not a trivial problem. Feeding arteries are small for instance, in which case a concentration in pure blood may not be accessible; or they are far from the tissue of interest, causing bolus dispersion errors or differences in signal properties that are difficult to correct for; or they are measured in rapidly flowing and pulsating blood where standard signal models may be inaccurate. \n\nIf the arterial input is inaccurately measured, then the input to the tissue is misinterpreted, and this will translate to an error in the measured parameters. To illustrate thiw, let's assume there is a partial volume in the AIF of patient A, causing its arterial blood concentration to be underestimated by a factor 2:\n\n"

        "The tissue perfusion is now overestimated with the same factor 2, which obviously could lead to entirely wrong conclusions as regards the grey matter health. An additional problem is that this type of error is difficult to control. If partial volume effects are present, they will cause different levels of overestimation in different measurements. So this not only causes a bias, but also a variability that will impact even on assessed changes over time in the same subject. \n\nAddressing those issues by experimental design may be possible to some extent, but may also require changes that are incompatible with other constraints. For instance, partial volume errors can be reduced by increasing the image resolution, but this may lead to acquisition times that are too long for blood flow measurement. \n\nAn alternative approach that is sometimes proposed is to avoid the use of a measured AIF alltogether, and instead use a standardized AIF measured once using a similar experiment on a representative population. A popular choice is the AIF presented in Parker et al (Magn Reson Med 200%), which is implemented in ``dcmri`` as the function ``aif_parker()``.\n\n"

The estimates for the blood flow values are a factor 2.6 and 1.7 underestimated, respectively. The analysis leads to the (false) conclusion that the cerebral blood volume and -flow values of B are 50% higher than A. \n\nHence, while a suitable chosen population AIF may produce values in the correct order of magnitude, it suffers from the same fundamental problem as descriptive or qualitative curve-type analyses that between subject differences in tissue curves are interpreted as reflecting tissue properties, even if in reality they are due to systemic differences (cardiac output in this example).\n\n\n"
